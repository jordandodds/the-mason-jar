This one comes from the guys who make the awesome [Porthole Infuser](http://www.theportholeinfuser.com/). As such the directions here are specifically for the porthole, but I imagine you could do the same with anything you usually use for infusions.


Ingredients
-----------

* 3 large strawberries
* 1/2 medium sized Navel or Valencia orange
* 2 oz roasted cacao nibs
* 7 oz Tequila Blanco (Herencia Mexicana is recommended)
* 2 3/4 oz (80g) Grand Marnier
* 1 dried chipotle pepper


Technique
-----------

* Wash fruit.
* Quarter strawberries lenghtwise, stem on, and fan-slice them. Cut orange cross-grain into 1/8” thick slices.
* Arrange 6 strawberry fans in Porthole, alternating skin and pulp facing the glass pane.
* Sprinkle half of cacao nibs on strawberries.
* Arrange a layer of orange slices.
* Sprinkle rest of cacao nibs on oranges. Arrange remaining strawberries, lightly packing the Porthole cavity.
* Close Porthole, tighten screw, squeeze, snug screws, and check for good seal.
* Combine tequila and Grand Marnier.
* Fill Porthole with combined liquids.
* Infuse for a minimum of 30 minutes before sampling, consume within 4 hours (extended infusion of orange rind will turn the infusion bitter).
